# Desktop Extensions (.DXT files)

A ".dxt" file, or Desktop Extension, is a new packaging format that simplifies the installation of local MCP (Model Context Protocol) servers, including their dependencies, with a single click.

This means that you can easily install and run complex MCP servers without manually configuring them, handling dependencies, or managing their installation process.

Here's how they work:

- Bundling: A .dxt file is essentially a ZIP archive that includes everything an MCP server needs to function, such as the server code itself, its dependencies (like Node.js packages or Python libraries), and a manifest.json file.
- One-click Installation: When you double-click a .dxt file, it automatically installs the server and its dependencies, eliminating the need for manual configuration or developer tools.
- Built-in Runtimes: Applications like Claude Desktop, which supports DXT, come with built-in runtimes (like Node.js) so users don't need to install them separately.
Benefits of using .dxt files for MCP servers
- Simplified Installation: Eliminates the need for manual configuration and dependency management, making it easier for users to get MCP servers up and running.
- Increased Accessibility: Makes powerful MCP servers accessible to a wider audience, not just developers.
- Secure Configuration: Sensitive data is stored securely in the operating system's keychain.
- Cross-platform Compatibility: DXT files are designed to work across Windows and macOS, with platform-specific overrides available if needed.

While DXT files are a relatively new development, they offer a convenient and efficient way to deploy and manage local MCP servers, significantly streamlining the process for both developers and users.
