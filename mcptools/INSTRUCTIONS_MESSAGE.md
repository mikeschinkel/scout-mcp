Your session token is valid for 24 hours and will be required for all subsequent tool calls.

IMPORTANT INSTRUCTIONS:
1. **Session Token Required**: All tools (except start_session) now require the session_token parameter
2. **Token Expiration**: Tokens expire after 24 hours or when the server restarts
3. **Language Instructions**: Review the language-specific instructions for proper coding style
4. **Validation**: If you see instruction files with non-standard names like 'golang.md', 'js.md', or 'py.md', warn the user that these should be renamed to 'go.md', 'javascript.md', and 'python.md' respectively for best compatibility

The tool help and server configuration are included below for your reference.
